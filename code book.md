###Variables

"subject": the subject who carried out the experiment. There are 30 subjects in total.

"activity": the activity carried out to get the measurements. There are 6 activities in total.

Other variables are mean values of each variable of each subject and activity. So there are 30*6=180 observations in this data set. The variables are coded in this way:

They're collected by accelerometer and gyroscope with 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ; the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ); "mean" in column names indicates mean value; "std" in column names indicates standard deviation.
